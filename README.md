3600sh
======
Code written by Arjuna Rao and Conor Golden

This is an implementation of a simple shell in C

This simple implementation is not unlike bash..it supports:
- command execution using UNIX commands
- the addition of qualifiers to these commands e.g. -a, -c
- input/output redirection

This shell will loop until the user inputs 'quit', prompting the user for input
